## 8. Retention & Anti-Churn — Designing Out Cancellation

---

## 14. Technical Debt & Architecture

### 14.1 Inter-Canister Call Audit (post-consolidation)
**Context:** The `price` canister was merged into `payment`, and the `room` canister was merged into `property`. Any code that still calls these as separate canisters (by principal ID or service binding) will break silently in production.

|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| 14.1.1 | Audit all canisters for cross-calls to `price` | ⬜ Missing | S | Grep all `.mo` files for `price` canister principal references; update any `actor(priceId)` calls to use `payment` canister's `getPricing`/`getAllPricing` queries instead |
