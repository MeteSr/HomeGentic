## 8. Retention & Anti-Churn — Designing Out Cancellation

## 10. For Sale By Owner (FSBO) Mode — Seller Without an Agent

**Strategic thesis:** Roughly 10% of US home sales are FSBO. These sellers are underserved by every major platform — Zillow makes it cumbersome, FSBO.com is dated, and no one gives them tools that actually equip them to negotiate, price, and close confidently. HomeFax's verified maintenance record is the best FSBO asset that exists: it pre-answers buyer objections, replaces an inspection contingency, and signals a serious, prepared seller. The app should be the platform that makes FSBO actually work.

## 12. Test Coverage — Gaps & Failing Areas

## 13. Benchmark & Load Testing

**Context:** HomeFax runs on ICP where cost is cycles-per-instruction, not per-request. Load testing has two goals: (1) throughput — can canisters handle concurrent users without queuing, and (2) cycles efficiency — are any calls burning disproportionate cycles that hit runway. The `monitoring` canister already tracks cycles and ARPU/LTV/CAC; what's missing is a baseline and stress scenarios.

---

### 13.1 Cycles Baseline — Cost Per Operation

Establish cycles cost for every significant canister call before any optimization work. Without a baseline, you can't measure improvement or catch regressions.

| # | Item | Status | Size | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| 13.1.1 | Baseline script for query calls | ⬜ Missing | S | Node.js script using `@dfinity/agent` that calls each read endpoint once and records cycles consumed; output CSV: canister, method, cycles_before, cycles_after, delta. Targets: `getMyProperties`, `getByProperty` (jobs), `getReport(token)`, `getSeasonalTasks`, `predictMaintenance` |
| 13.1.2 | Baseline script for update calls | ⬜ Missing | S | Same pattern for write paths: `createJob`, `generateReport`, `addVisitLog`, `createRecurringService`, `createRequest` (quote). Update calls go through consensus — latency matters as much as cycles |
| 13.1.3 | Identify top-3 cycles-heavy operations | ⬜ Missing | S | Run 13.1.1 + 13.1.2, sort by delta, flag any call above 1B cycles as a review candidate. `analyzeCompetitivePosition()` (market, 535 lines) and `predictMaintenance()` (iterates 8 systems) are the likely suspects |
| 13.1.4 | Integrate baseline into `monitoring` canister metrics | ⬜ Missing | M | Expose a `cyclesPerCall` map in `monitoring` canister's `metrics()` query; update it on each significant call so cost-per-operation is visible in the admin dashboard over time |

---

### 13.2 Canister Throughput & Concurrency

| # | Item | Status | Size | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| 13.2.1 | Concurrent read stress test — `getReport` | ⬜ Missing | M | Simulate a HomeFax report URL shared in a real estate listing: fire 200 concurrent `getReport(token)` calls over 60 seconds via `@dfinity/agent`. Measure: p50/p95/p99 latency, error rate, cycles total. This is the most realistic "viral" scenario |
| 13.2.2 | Concurrent write stress test — `createJob` | ⬜ Missing | M | 50 concurrent `createJob` calls (simulating a busy contractor day). Measure consensus latency distribution, queue depth, any dropped calls. Update calls serialize through consensus — expect higher p99 |
| 13.2.3 | Contractor dashboard poll simulation | ⬜ Missing | S | 50 contractors refreshing `getOpenRequests()` every 30 seconds for 10 minutes. Query calls are cheap but volume can still saturate; measure cycles burn rate vs. expected monthly cost |
| 13.2.4 | Report generation spike | ⬜ Missing | M | 25 simultaneous `generateReport()` calls (snapshot creation + share link issuance). Tests canister stable memory write performance under concurrency |
| 13.2.5 | Cross-canister call latency | ⬜ Missing | M | Measure end-to-end latency for calls that touch multiple canisters: job creation (job → photo → property tier check), sensor Critical event (sensor → job auto-create). Inter-canister calls add latency per hop |

---

### 13.3 Algorithmic Load — Heavy Canister Methods

| # | Item | Status | Size | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| 13.3.1 | `market` canister — `analyzeCompetitivePosition()` under load | ⬜ Missing | M | Largest canister (535 lines). Call with properties ranging from 1 to 100 jobs; chart cycles cost vs. input size. Flag if O(n²) or worse behavior exists in scoring loops |
| 13.3.2 | `maintenance` canister — `predictMaintenance()` at scale | ⬜ Missing | S | Call with build years from 1950 to 2024 for all 8 system types. Verify constant-time lookup (should be table-driven, not iterative). Measure with 1, 10, and 50 concurrent calls |
| 13.3.3 | `report` canister — snapshot size growth | ⬜ Missing | S | Generate reports with 0, 10, 50, 200 jobs and measure: snapshot serialization cycles, stable memory footprint, `getReport` deserialization time. Identify the point where large job histories create noticeable latency |
| 13.3.4 | `monitoring` canister — metrics aggregation under load | ⬜ Missing | S | Call `getMetrics()` while simultaneously running 13.2.1–13.2.4. Verify the monitoring canister doesn't become a bottleneck when all other canisters are logging to it concurrently |

---

### 13.4 Frontend Rendering Performance

| # | Item | Status | Size | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| 13.4.1 | Dashboard rendering with large dataset | ⬜ Missing | M | Inject 25 properties + 200 jobs via `window.__e2e_*` and measure: time to first meaningful paint, React render time, scroll performance. The `Promise.all` in `DashboardPage` fetches all properties + jobs + recurring services in parallel — verify it doesn't block render |
| 13.4.2 | ReportPage rendering with 200-job snapshot | ⬜ Missing | S | Load a report snapshot containing 200 job records, 10 recurring services. Measure render time — this is a public page that buyers see; slow renders kill trust |
| 13.4.3 | Playwright performance baseline for key pages | ⬜ Missing | M | Use Playwright's `page.metrics()` to capture JS heap, DOM nodes, and layout duration for Dashboard, PropertyDetail, ReportPage. Commit as a baseline; alert on >20% regression. Ties into 12.6.2 |
| 13.4.4 | Bundle size audit | ⬜ Missing | S | Run `npm run build` and analyze `frontend/dist/` with `vite-bundle-visualizer`. Identify any unexpectedly large dependencies. Target: initial JS bundle < 200KB gzipped |

---

### 13.5 Load Test Scenarios — Realistic User Journeys

End-to-end scenarios that combine multiple calls, matching how real users interact with the app.

| # | Item | Status | Size | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| 13.5.1 | "Sell day" scenario | ⬜ Missing | M | Sequence: load ResaleReady checklist → view HomeFax score → generate report → create listing bid request. Measure total wall-clock time and total cycles burned end-to-end. This is the highest-value user journey |
| 13.5.2 | "Buyer due diligence" scenario | ⬜ Missing | S | Sequence: open shared report URL → view all sections → click score cert → view contractor public profiles. Entirely read-path; test with 100 concurrent "buyers" against one report token |
| 13.5.3 | "Active homeowner" scenario | ⬜ Missing | M | Simulate a homeowner who logs 3 jobs, adds 2 visit logs, uploads a photo, and regenerates their report in a single session. Measures realistic write load per engaged user |
| 13.5.4 | "Agent competition" scenario | ⬜ Missing | M | Once Section 9 (listing bid marketplace) is built: 10 agents simultaneously submit proposals to the same listing bid request. Tests write contention on the listing canister |

---

### 13.6 Infrastructure & Tooling

| # | Item | Status | Size | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| 13.6.1 | `scripts/benchmark.sh` harness | ⬜ Missing | M | Bash/Node script that runs the full baseline suite (13.1.1 + 13.1.2) against a local replica and outputs a Markdown summary table. Run manually before each release; eventually CI on deploy |
| 13.6.2 | k6 load test suite for Express proxy | ⬜ Missing | M | k6 scripts targeting `POST /api/agent` and `POST /api/chat` on the voice agent server (port 3001). Scenarios: 1 VU ramp to 50, sustained 50 VU for 5 minutes, spike to 200 VU. Measures Anthropic API latency contribution vs. canister latency |
| 13.6.3 | Cycles burn rate dashboard | ⬜ Missing | M | Surface `monitoring` canister metrics in `AdminDashboardPage`: cycles remaining per canister, burn rate (cycles/day), estimated runway (days until top-up needed). Alert threshold at 30-day runway |
| 13.6.4 | Performance regression gate in CI | ⬜ Missing | L | After baseline is established (13.1.1–13.1.2): add a CI step that runs the baseline script on every PR and fails if any call regresses by >25% in cycles cost. Requires a lightweight local replica in CI |

## 14. Security — Audit Findings & Hardening

**Audit scope:** ~3,500 lines of Motoko across 14 canisters + ~2,000 lines of TypeScript/React + Express voice agent proxy. Audit completed 2026-03-27. Issues are ordered by severity.

---

### 14.4 Low / Hardening

| # | Item | Status | Size | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| 14.4.1 | Warranty expiry timestamp overflow | ⬜ Missing | S | **LOW.** `useVoiceAgent.ts` computes warranty expiry as `Date.getTime() + warrantyMonths * MS_PER_MONTH`. Extreme values (year 2100 start date + 100-year warranty) can produce a number beyond JS `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`. Fix: clamp to a reasonable max date (e.g., year 2100) before comparison. |
| 14.4.2 | Secrets audit — confirm no keys in codebase | ⬜ Missing | S | Add `git-secrets` or `gitleaks` pre-commit hook to scan for API keys, private keys, and secrets patterns. Confirm `.env` is in `.gitignore` and `.env.example` contains only placeholders. Run a one-time `gitleaks detect` scan on full git history. |
| 14.4.3 | Stable memory schema migration safety | ⬜ Missing | M | The `report` canister's addition of `recurringServices` to `ReportSnapshot` is a breaking stable variable change. Old snapshots deserialized after upgrade will have an empty field (safe in this case due to Motoko's default handling), but there is no documented upgrade checklist or rollback plan. Fix: document a canister upgrade runbook (stop → redeploy → verify → rollback procedure) and add a schema version field to `ReportSnapshot`. |
| 14.4.4 | Canister `pause()` has no timeout or auto-recovery | ⬜ Missing | S | A paused canister stays paused indefinitely — if an admin principal is lost or compromised, the canister cannot be unpaused. Fix: add an optional `pauseDurationSeconds` parameter; auto-unpause after the duration. Alternatively, require 2-of-N admin approval to pause in production. |
| 14.4.5 | Verify `fetchRootKey` is never called in production | ⬜ Missing | S | `actor.ts` correctly gates `shouldFetchRootKey: IS_LOCAL`. Add a CI lint rule or build-time assertion that fails if `fetchRootKey: true` appears in any production code path. This is a defense-in-depth check — a future developer could accidentally enable it. |
| 14.4.6 | Anthropic API key not exposed to frontend — confirm in build | ⬜ Missing | S | The voice agent proxy correctly holds `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` server-side and never sends it to the browser. Confirm this is enforced in the Vite config — no `VITE_ANTHROPIC_*` prefixed env var should exist, as Vite automatically inlines `VITE_*` vars into the bundle. Add a build step that greps `dist/` for the key pattern. |
| 14.4.7 | Migrate `agents/iot-gateway` from deprecated `@dfinity/*` to `@icp-sdk/core` | ⬜ Missing | M | **LOW.** `@dfinity/{agent,candid,identity,principal}` 1.x are deprecated in favour of `@icp-sdk/core` (migration guide: https://js.icp.build/core/latest/upgrading/v5). Current installs are on 1.4.0 (patched, no CVEs). Migrate before the gateway is built out — the API surface is small (`HttpAgent`, `Actor`, `Ed25519KeyIdentity`, `IDL`) so the change should be mechanical. Do this before the IoT gateway (1.3.6) is productionised. |

## 15. Free Tier Tightening — Conversion Urgency

**Problem:** The free tier currently gives away the full value proposition — unlimited job logging, permanent shareable reports, full score breakdown, market intelligence, and warranty wallet. There is no natural forcing function to upgrade. A homeowner can prepare their home for sale entirely on the free tier.

**Strategy:** Free users get enough to feel the value and get hooked, but hit professional-grade walls at the exact moment they need to use it seriously — when preparing to list or sell.

**The upgrade moment:** *"I'm ready to list — let me share my report"* → 7-day expiry warning → upgrade to Pro for a permanent, unbranded link.

---

### 15.2 Report Share Link Expiry

| # | Item | Status | Size | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| 15.2.1 | Default share link TTL to 7 days for free tier | ✅ Done | M | In `report` canister `generateReport()`, check caller's tier. If Free, set `expiresAt = now + 7 days` regardless of what the caller passes. Pro+ retain the current behavior (caller-controlled expiry, including null = never). |
| 15.2.2 | Warn free users before link expires in `ReportPage` | ✅ Done | S | When a report is loaded and the share link expires within 48 hours, show a banner: "This report link expires [date]. Upgrade to Pro for a permanent link." |
| 15.2.3 | Show expiry in `GenerateReportModal` for free users | ✅ Done | S | In the success screen shown after `reportService.generateReport()` resolves (the screen that displays the shareable URL), add a conditional block below the URL: if the user is on Free, show an amber info row — "⚠ This link expires in 7 days · [Upgrade to Pro →]". If Pro+, show a green confirmation row — "✓ This link never expires". Check tier from `useAuthStore` / `paymentService.getSubscription()`. This is informational only, not a blocker — the user has already generated the report. |
| 15.2.4 | Expired free report shows upgrade prompt, not generic error | ✅ Done | S | When `getReport()` returns a revoked/expired token, `ReportPage` currently shows a generic error. For free-tier-expired links, show: "This HomeFax report has expired. The homeowner can upgrade to Pro to share a permanent link." |

---

### 15.3 Report Branding (Free Plan Watermark)

| # | Item | Status | Size | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| 15.3.1 | Add `planTier` field to `ReportSnapshot` in `report` canister | ⬜ Missing | S | Add `planTier: Text` to the `ReportSnapshot` record type (use `Text` rather than importing the `Tier` variant from the payment canister to avoid inter-canister type coupling; valid values: `"Free"`, `"Pro"`, `"Premium"`, `"ContractorPro"`). In `generateReport()`, call `paymentCanister.getSubscription(msg.caller)`, read the tier, and store it in the snapshot. Requires `paymentCanisterId` stable var + `setPaymentCanisterId()` admin function (same pattern as 15.1.1). Update the IDL in `frontend/src/services/report.ts` to add `planTier: IDL.Text` to the `ReportSnapshot` record, and add `planTier: string` to the TypeScript interface. Old snapshots (before this field exists) will deserialize with an empty string — treat `""` as `"Free"` in the frontend. |
| 15.3.2 | Render "Free Plan" banner on `ReportPage` for free-tier reports | ✅ Done | S | When `snapshot.planTier === "Free"`, show a banner at the top of the public report: "Generated with HomeFax Free — upgrade to remove this banner and unlock permanent sharing." Buyers see this; it signals to them that the seller hasn't committed to the platform. |
| 15.3.3 | Remove banner from Pro+ reports | ⬜ Missing | S | Pro and Premium reports render with no banner, clean header, and a "Verified by HomeFax" trust badge instead. This makes the Pro report visually superior and the difference obvious. |

---

### 15.4 Score Breakdown Gating

| # | Item | Status | Size | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| 15.4.1 | Show score number on free tier, lock breakdown | ✅ Done | M | The score breakdown appears in two places: (1) `DashboardPage` — the per-property score section, and (2) `PropertyDetailPage` — the Score tab. Apply the gate in both. Free users see the large score number and grade (e.g., "74 · C+") unchanged. The four scoring pillars rendered below it (`scoreService.computeScore()` returns `verifiedJobPts`, `valuePts`, `verificationPts`, `diversityPts`) are replaced with a single `<UpgradeGate>` card (see 15.7.1): icon 🔍, title "Score Breakdown", description "See exactly what's dragging your score down — upgrade to Pro." The gate check is: `if (tier === "Free") show gate else show pillars`. Read tier from `paymentService.getSubscription()` called once in the page's `useEffect`, stored in local state. |
| 15.4.2 | Lock improvement recommendations on free tier | ✅ Done | S | The "How to improve your score" action list (currently shown on Dashboard and PropertyDetailPage) is Pro-only. Free users see: "3 actions available — upgrade to see them." |
| 15.4.3 | Show full breakdown in score cert for Pro+ | ⬜ Missing | S | `ScoreCertPage` shows full breakdown for Pro+. Free users who earn a cert (score ≥88) still get the cert number, but the detailed sub-scores are blurred with an upgrade prompt. |

---

### 15.6 Feature Locks — High-Value Pages

| # | Item | Status | Size | Notes |
|---|------|--------|------|-------|
| 15.6.1 | Lock Recurring Services on free tier | ✅ Done | S | Free users who navigate to `/recurring/new` see an upgrade gate page instead of the create form: "Recurring service contracts are a Pro feature — track lawn care, pest control, and pool maintenance with a Pro plan." This is a strong differentiator because contract continuity is exactly what buyers want to see. |
| 15.6.2 | Lock Market Intelligence on free tier | ✅ Done | S | `MarketIntelligencePage` shows a locked state for free users: "See how your home's maintenance investment compares to your neighbors — upgrade to Pro." The competitive positioning data is pure selling value and has no place on a free tier. |
| 15.6.3 | Lock Warranty Wallet on free tier | ✅ Done | S | `WarrantyWalletPage` shows a locked state: "Track active warranties and get expiry alerts — upgrade to Pro." Warranty data is high perceived value (especially for HVAC, roof, appliances) and easy to gate. |
| 15.6.4 | Lock Agent Marketplace and FSBO on free tier | ✅ Done | S | Both the listing bid request flow (Section 9) and FSBO mode (Section 10) require Pro or Premium. Free users who navigate to these flows see: "Selling your home? Upgrade to Pro to make agents compete for your listing — or go FSBO with our full toolkit." This is the highest-value gate of all. |
| 15.6.5 | Lock Insurance Defense on free tier | ✅ Done | S | `InsuranceDefensePage` is Pro-only. Free users see a locked state: "Build your evidence file for insurance claims — upgrade to Pro." |
